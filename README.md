# PNWMD - Pacific Northwest Meditation Deathmatch installation
This project was built by Brey Tucker, Alyssa Haas and Greg Borreson with the assistance of an art installation grant from Bass Coast Festival for 2018. It was inspired by and borrows the base premise from previous Meditation Deathmatch projects but took some of its own liberties. Participants were affixed with EEG headbands to measure their brainwaves and then competed to RELAX HARDER in a deeply distracting environment while being alternately heckled and read passages from very dry books via megaphone.

Two Processing 3 sketches included:
 - PNWMD_diagnostic_stars: LED testing and a passive visualizer for when the installation was not in service
 - PNWMD_brains_phyllo: OSC receiver for Muse headbands, chillness scoring & chillness-responsive visualizer
 
Hardware we used:
 - a laptop running the sketches
 - two Muse 2016 headbands
 - two smartphones running Muse Direct forwarding data to the sketch via OSC
 - a Wi-Fi router for those smartphones and some ethernet connectivity
 - a HeroicRobotics PixelPusher LED driver connected by ethernet
 - two large plywood & steel meditation pods with a whole lot of WS2813 LED strips in them each
